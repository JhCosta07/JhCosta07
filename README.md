I am a Computer Science student at Unifil, I am in the first year of the course and I still have a lot to learn. I had a brief contact with programming during school, it was on my own, I didn't have time to delve too deep into a language like JavaScript or <strong>PHP</strong> itself because I had to dedicate myself to studies, but in a new phase I intend to dive into the world of Backend.
